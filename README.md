# Transport App Replica

Welcome to the Transport Replica App repository! This project aims to revolutionize the transport industry by harnessing the power of decentralization while offering seamless user experiences for both drivers and passengers. We've incorporated a wide range of technologies to make this vision a reality.

## Features

- **Decentralization**: Our app leverages decentralized storage and data processing, ensuring enhanced security, privacy, and scalability. By utilizing cutting-edge decentralized technologies, we're committed to providing a trustworthy platform for users and drivers alike.

- **Multi-language Support**: The app is developed using multiple programming languages to provide a comprehensive experience. We've utilized JavaScript, Java, Ruby, Objective-C, and Starlark to create a robust and versatile foundation.

- **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: Our team has put in the effort to develop the app for both Android and iOS platforms. Thanks to the use of Android Studio and React JS, we've ensured a consistent and user-friendly interface across devices.
